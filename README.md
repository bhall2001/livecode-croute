# Cro没te
Livecode test library for Levure that may resemble jest a bit

Let's see where this goes...
Cro没te translated from French is crust. In keeping with Levure's french theme, I thought cro没te is a fitting name for a test library -- a loaf of bread is nothing without a great crust!

This is a testing framework written for Livecode intended to be used as a Levure helper. The initial work essentially takes what Trevore Devore's testing code is for Levure. I'd like to see if we can have more of a BDD style to the project so I'm heading in a direction to make this look like jest. If you don't know what jest is don't worry. If you do, notice I said "look like".

### Project Status
As you can see, there is really nothing here yet. I'm working on an initial commit that will essentially be what is included in current Levure framework for testing. I'll expand off of that once I get going.

### Using Cro没te
`describe name, fn`

`test name, fn`

`expect(exp1, Matcher, exp2)`

Matchers are:
  `toBe` (tbd)
  
  `toEqual` (tbd)
  
  `toBeEmpty` (tbd)
  
  `toBeTrue` (tbd)
  
  `toBeFalse` (tbd)
  
  `not.` (tbd)
  
  `toBeGreaterThan` (tbd)
  
  `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual` (tbd)
  
  `toBeLessThen` (tbd)
  
  `toBeLessThenOrEqual` (tbd)
  
  `toMatch` (tbd)
  
  `toContain` (tbd)
  
  `toThrow` (tbd)
  
### Sample uses
This is the simplest way to test a value
  
```
test "two plus two is four", "twoPlusTwoIsFour"
  
command twoPlusTwoIsFour
  expect(2+2, toBe, 4)
end twoPlusTwoIsFour
```
  
In this code, 2+2 is evaluated with the result being 4. The match "toBe" then compares to 4 to determine if the test succeeds.

You can also test the opposite of a matcher:
  
```
test "adding positive numbers is not zero", "testForPositive"
  
command testForPositive
  repeat with a = 1 to 10
    repeat with b = 1 to 10
      expect(a+b, not.toBe, 0)
    end repeat
  end repeat
end testForPositive
```

In this test, the indexes a and b are added together with the results expected to not be 0.
